    "bot": "Cats are fascinating creatures!  Did you know that they have over 30 muscles in their ears, which allows them to precisely rotate and hear sounds from multiple directions?  That's why their eyes seem so alert even when they're just lounging on a sunny windowsill.  \n\nThey also have incredible agility. Their flexible bodies and special bone structure allow them to jump and climb with astonishing grace. Some cats are even natural hunters! \n\nI could tell you all sorts of things about cat behavior, but would you like to hear something about their grooming habits? \ud83d\ude09 \n"

Their tongue is covered with keratinized papillae which helps in removing dirt and dead hair. And let me tell you, it's fascinating to watch them do it.  \n\nDo you want to know more about the different types of cat grooming routines? \ud83d\ude39\n"
